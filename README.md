# markov-bot
Slack bot that regurgitates peoples own words back at them

TODO:
 - Incorporate sentence start and sentence end tokens
 - More sophisticated tokenization in general using an external tokenizer that can handle punctuation nicely 
 - Change bot argument syntax so that you can see somebody's generated text without notifying them on slack
 - Better error handling
 - Length of generated text as argument instead of constant
 - Redesign database model to support arbitrary n-grams
