# markov-bot
Slack bot that regurgitates peoples own words back at them

TODO:
 - Refactor copy and pasted all flag code
 - Change bot argument syntax so that you can see somebody's generated text without notifying them on slack
 - Better error handling
 - Length of generated text as argument instead of constant
 - Redesign database model to support arbitrary n-grams
